Some\n things are worth noting here:\n \n - Since `Rng: RngCore` and every `RngCore` implements `Rng`, it makes no\n   difference whether we use `R: Rng` or `R: RngCore`.\n - The `+ ?Sized` un-bounding allows functions to be called directly on\n   type-erased references; i.e. `foo(r)` where `r: &mut RngCore`. Without\n   this it would be necessary to write `foo(&mut r)`.\n \n An alternative pattern is possible: `fn foo<R: Rng>(rng: R)`. This has some\n trade-offs. It allows the argument to be consumed directly without a `&mut`\n (which is how `from_rng(thread_rng())` works); also it still works directly\n on references (including type-erased references). Unfortunately within the\n function `foo` it is not known whether `rng` is a reference type or not,\n hence many uses of `rng` require an extra reference, either explicitly\n (`distr.sample(&mut rng)`) or implicitly (`rng.gen()`); one may hope the\n optimiser can remove redundant references later.\n \n Example:\n \n ```\n # use rand::thread_rng;\n use rand::Rng;\n \n fn foo<R: Rng + ?Sized>(rng: &mut R) -> f32 {\n     rng.gen()\n }","sig":null,"attributes":[]},{"kind":"Method","id":{"krate":0,"index":1688},"span":{"file_name":[47,85,115,101,114,115,47,116,111,115,104,105,97,107,105,117,110,111,47,46,99,97,114,103,111,47,114,101,103,105,115,116,114,121,47,115,114,99,47,103,105,116,104,117,98,46,99,111,109,45,49,101,99,99,54,50,57,57,100,98,57,101,99,56,50,51,47,114,97,110,100,45,48,46,53,46,52,47,115,114,99,47,108,105,98,46,114,115],"byte_start":16553,"byte_end":16556,"line_start":428,"line_end":428,"column_start":8,"column_end":11},"name":"gen","qualname":"::Rng::gen","value":"fn <T> (&mut self) -> T","parent":{"krate":0,"index":1686},"children":[],"decl_id":null,"docs":" An automatically-implemented extension trait on [`RngCore`] providing high-level\n generic methods for sampling values and other convenience methods.\n \n This is the primary trait to use when generating random values.\n \n # Generic usage\n \n The basic pattern is `fn foo<R: Rng + ?Sized>(rng: &mut R)`.
